19.⁠ ⁠Implementation of Naive Bayes classification for Bank Loan prediction

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

Load data
data = pd.read_csv('bank_loan_data.csv')

Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('loan_status', axis=1)
y = data['loan_status']

Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Create and train a Naive Bayes classifier
clf = GaussianNB()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
