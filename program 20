20.⁠ ⁠Implement Future Sales Prediction using a suitable machine learning algorithm

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

Load data
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('sales', axis=1)
y = data['sales']

Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
