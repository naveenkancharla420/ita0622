Here are some Python programs for various machine learning algorithms and applications:

1.⁠ ⁠FIND-S Algorithm

import pandas as pd

Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

FIND-S algorithm
def find_s(data):
    # Initialize hypothesis
    hypothesis = ['0'] * len(data.columns)

    # Iterate over data
    for index, row in data.iterrows():
        # Check if row is positive
        if row['target'] == 'yes':
            # Update hypothesis
            for i in range(len(hypothesis)):
                if hypothesis[i] == '0':
                    hypothesis[i] = row[i]
                elif hypothesis[i] != row[i]:
                    hypothesis[i] = '?'

    return hypothesis
